# Capstan-OSSM-XL
Revamp of the OSSM drive mechanism to use a capstan based version, enabling higher load use with a more powerful motor, namely the 60AIM40F.

A Capstan Drive is based on rope and a pulley. For a nice video explaining the mechanism, check this awesome video by Aaed Musa: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwIBTbumd1Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwIBTbumd1Q "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwIBTbumd1Q")

**Why Capstan?**

The belt driven Version has shown for myself and quite a few others limitations. At higher torques, it would sometimes slip. Bear in mind, it could be that is the result from build or other errors.

**Comparison to the standard OSSM**

Pro:

 - same form factor
 - as quiet or quieter
 - only 13cm of effective rail length loss
 - 2.7 times stronger (32kg compared to 12kg)
 - same speed
 - no slipping
 - no custom pcbs required
 - PitClamp compatible
 - compatible with all custom end effectors

Con:

 - harder to build
 - bigger motor -> more expensive (~110â‚¬ shipped incl. tax to germany)
 - more to print
 - in extreme use cases there may be slipping of the rail over time, is fixed by rerunning homing
 - only tried and tested by me so far
 
This machine has served me very well for the past months now, I am personally very happy with it. Provide feedback an suggestions in the discord thread.

# Capstan Proof of Concept
This was my first version. It is a proof of concept with quite a few flaws that I have abandoned to see if it is at all a viable concept. This is using 57AIM30 or 42AIM30 motors. You can try this first if you are sceptical to drop over a hundred bucks on a new motor. Bear in mind that quite a bit has changed since then. Changes that are not updated for this Proof of Concept. It worked good enough for me to use it, but it may not for you. The imo truly fleshed out Version is the Capstan XL.

# Quick Change Strap Toy Mount remix
For compatibility with smaller print beds, I remixed @arctan and @marc_o_v [Quick Change Strap Toy Mount](https://discord.com/channels/559409652425687041/1278049440787337226). It detaches the straps from the Ring. From my experience, this is very secure and only slips under high load when lube come into contact with the connection.

# Suction Cup Bracket
A bracket to mount [these](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006355052746.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.4.5b3d5c5fPcSZQr&gatewayAdapt=glo2deu) suction cups to 4040 extrusion (tested with aluxprofile Type I). The suction Cups are very strong, I use a total of 4 on my shicks mount. This has the big advantage to not loose any stability that comes with the shicks mount whatsover.
Requires one suction cup and one UNC-1/4 20 screw for each bracket.
